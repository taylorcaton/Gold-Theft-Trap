# RPS-Multiplayer
A multiplayer Gold, Theft, Trap game, (a variation on Rock, Paper, Scissors) using Firebase and jQuery.

## How to Play
Grab a friend and have them play you in a seprate browser!

Gold: you will immediately gain 1 Gold.

Theft: you gain all the gold the opposing player has. Also, if they chose the Gold this round you get the Gold they would have gained from that too.

Trap: it does nothing unless the opposing player played Theft. If they did, your trap kills them in the act of thieving and you instantly win the game.
